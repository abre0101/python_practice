# YOLO Badge Guide 🎯

## What you need: Merge a pull request without code review

### Method 1: Solo Repository (Easiest - 2 minutes)

**Step 1: Create a branch and PR**
```bash
git checkout -b yolo-feature
echo "YOLO commit" >> test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "Add YOLO feature"
git push origin yolo-feature
```

**Step 2: On GitHub**
1. Create pull request from `yolo-feature`
2. **Immediately merge it** (don't request review, don't wait)
3. Click "Merge pull request" → "Confirm merge"

✅ **Done!** The YOLO badge is yours.
