# Python Practice 🐍

A comprehensive collection of Python fundamentals with detailed examples and explanations.

## 📋 Contents

This repository contains `app.py` - a well-organized Python practice file covering 17 essential topics:

1. **Variables and Data Types** - integers, floats, booleans, strings
2. **String Formatting** - f-strings and formatted literals
3. **String Operations** - length, indexing, slicing, escape sequences
4. **String Concatenation** - combining strings using different methods
5. **String Methods** - upper, lower, strip, find, replace, and more
6. **Numeric Data Types** - int, float, complex numbers
7. **Arithmetic Operators** - division, floor division, exponentiation
8. **Math Module** - round, abs, ceil functions
9. **User Input** - getting and processing user input
10. **String Slicing Practice** - extracting substrings
11. **Conditional Statements** - if/elif/else structures
12. **Ternary Operator** - one-line conditionals
13. **Logical Operators** - and, or, not
14. **Comparison Operators** - chaining comparisons
15. **For Loops** - range, nested loops, iterating over sequences
16. **While Loops** - condition-based iteration
17. **Functions** - basic functions, parameters, return values, *args

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python app.py
```

## 💡 Features

- ✅ Clean, organized code structure
- ✅ Detailed comments explaining every concept
- ✅ Practical examples for each topic
- ✅ Progressive learning from basics to advanced
- ✅ Ready-to-run code snippets

## 📚 Learning Path

This code is structured to follow a logical learning progression:
- Start with basic data types and variables
- Move to string manipulation and formatting
- Progress to control flow (conditionals and loops)
- End with functions and modular code

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a reference guide and practice resource for Python fundamentals. Each section is self-contained with clear examples that can be run independently.
